                <p> This is by far one of the tastiest curries you will ever consume. It's 
            100% vegan, and full of flavour. The base is chickpeas with coconut milk. 
            Potatoes add starchiness and heft to this dish, while the tomatoes and green mangoes add a sour bite. Onions, curry leaves
            and spices such as cumin round out this delectable dish.

                </ul>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil some water in a small-medium pot, adding a pinch of salt</li>
                    <li>Cut the potatoes into squares, leaving skin on</li>
                    <li>Place potatoes in boiling water and let boil for 20+ minutes</li>
                    <li> Meanwhile, cut onions, dice the tomatoes </li>
                    <li> Wash mango and cut with skin on into 1 inch squares </li>
                    <li> oil up a pot and let the oil warm up on medium</li>
                    <li> once hot, place cut onions and a handful of curry leaves into pot stirring around until onions are golden brown</li>
                    <li> add coconut milk and tomatoes to the pot </li>
                    <li> increase heat to medium-high</li>
                    <li>add 1 table spoon of curry sauce and mix thoroughly</li>
                    <li>add mangoes</li>
                    <li> add chickpeas</li>
                    <li> Check potatoes to see if they are ready by poking with a fork. They should be soft and easy to penetrate</li>
                    <li> Drain some water out of the potatoe pot, and throw the rest along with the potatoes into the main pot</li>
                    <li>mix around, adding cumin, salt, pepper and hot peppers to taste</li>
                    <li> keep the temprature high enough for some of the water to boil off, you are aiming for a medium-thick consistency</li>
                    <li> once ideal thickness is reached, put to low temp and let simmer for a minimum of 60 minutes to bring out the flavours</li>
                    <li> Serve with rice, roti, or our favourite, wild rice!</li>
